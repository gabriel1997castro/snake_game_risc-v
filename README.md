# __Snake Game - assembly risc-v__

##  About
The game was implemented by students of Control and Automation in the University of Brasilia while studying Computers Architecture and Organization. The participants are:
* Gabriel Castro
* Lucas Ferreira
* Rodrigo Ara√∫jo
* Stephanie Cardoso

The professor was [Marcelo Antonio Marotta](https://github.com/marcelom87).

The version of rars in this code was modificated by the [Dr. Marcus Vinicius Lamar](https://github.com/mvlamar). There are some pieces
of code made by Lamar to help his students to do their works. 

## The game

### __Processor Registers__
There are some constant registers because they are used frequently in the code:

| Registradores | Uso                                                                   |
